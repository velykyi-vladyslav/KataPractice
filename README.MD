# Kata Practice
## _What is Kata_
Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.
## _Project structure_
The project contains a batch structure that is inversely proportional to the levels at [CodeWars_KATA](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). The first level is the easiest and the 8th level is the most difficult to practice.
